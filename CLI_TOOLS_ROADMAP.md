# FDML CLI Tools Development Roadmap

> **Strategic roadmap for developing command-line tools that support the FDML specification**

## Executive Summary

This roadmap outlines the development of CLI tools for the Feature-Driven Modeling Language (FDML) specification v1.3. The tools will enable developers to parse, validate, generate code, and manage FDML specifications effectively.

## Goals & Vision

### Primary Goals
- **Validation & Parsing**: Robust FDML specification validation and parsing
- **Code Generation**: Multi-language code generation from FDML specs
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive CLI interface for daily development workflows
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Seamless integration with existing development tools

### Success Metrics
- Sub-second validation of medium-sized FDML files (< 1000 entities)
- Support for 3+ target languages (TypeScript, Python, Go)
- 90%+ test coverage across all CLI components
- Active community adoption and contribution

## Phase 1: Foundation & Core Parser (Weeks 1-4)

### 1.1 Project Setup & Architecture

**Deliverables:**
- [ ] Project structure and build system
- [ ] Technology stack decision (Recommended: Rust for performance + TypeScript for ecosystem)
- [ ] Core architecture documentation
- [ ] Development environment setup

**Technical Decisions:**
```
Primary Language: Rust (for CLI performance and reliability)
Alternative: TypeScript/Node.js (for faster ecosystem adoption)
Package Management: Cargo (Rust) or NPM (TypeScript)
Testing Framework: Built-in test harness
Documentation: mdBook or similar
```

**Architecture Overview:**
```

│   ├── validator/       # Validation rules and constraints
│   ├── generator/       # Code generation framework
│   ├── commands/        # CLI command implementations
│   └── utils/           # Shared utilities
├── tests/
├── examples/
└── docs/
```

### 1.2 FDML Parser Implementation

**Core Components:**
- [ ] YAML parser with FDML schema validation
- [ ] AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) representation
- [ ] Error handling and user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Support for all FDML v1.3 constructs:
  - [ ] System definitions
  - [ ] Entity definitions
  - [ ] Action definitions
  - [ ] Feature definitions
  - [ ] Flow definitions
  - [ ] Constraint definitions
  - [ ] Traceability links

**Parser API Design:**
```rust
// Example Rust API
pub struct FDMLParser {
    pub fn parse_file(path: &Path) -> Result<FDMLDocument, ParseError>;
    pub fn parse_string(content: &str) -> Result<FDMLDocument, ParseError>;
    pub fn validate(&self, doc: &FDMLDocument) -> Vec<ValidationError>;
}
```

### 1.3 Basic CLI Interface

**Commands to Implement:**
```bash
fdml parse <file>          # Parse and validate FDML file
fdml validate <file>       # Comprehensive validation
fdml info <file>          # Display file information and statistics
fdml version              # Show version information
fdml help                 # Show help information
```

**Success Criteria:**
- [ ] Successfully parse all examples from FDML specification
- [ ] Comprehensive error messages with line numbers and suggestions
- [ ] Sub-100ms parsing time for typical FDML files

## Phase 2: Validation & Quality Assurance (Weeks 5-6)

### 2.1 Advanced Validation Rules

**Validation Categories:**
- [ ] **Syntax Validation**: YAML structure and FDML schema compliance
- [ ] **Semantic Validation**: Cross-references, type consistency, constraint validation
- [ ] **Business Rules**: Domain-specific validation rules
- [ ] **Best Practices**: Style guide enforcement and recommendations

**Validation Rules to Implement:**
```yaml
# Example validation rules
- unique_ids: All IDs must be unique within their scope
- type_consistency: Field types must match across references
- constraint_validity: Constraints must be applicable to field types
- traceability_integrity: All traceability links must reference valid elements
- circular_dependency_detection: Detect and report circular dependencies
```

### 2.2 Linting & Style Guide

**Linting Features:**
- [ ] Naming convention enforcement
- [ ] Required field validation
- [ ] Deprecated pattern detection
- [ ] Performance anti-pattern warnings

**Commands:**
```bash
fdml lint <file>           # Run all linting rules
